## Profile Page
This project is a single-screen application designed to display a user's "profile information" page. The app simulates a profile page for a social networking application, such as a professional networking platform or a dating app.

The application demonstrates the use of various Flutter widgets for layout and display while maintaining clean, reusable, and maintainable code.
## Project Overview
The Profile Page Using Dart project showcases a user profile interface with interactive elements. The page is designed to highlight the user's personal and professional details in a clean, responsive, and intuitive layout. This project serves as an example of using Dart for frontend development and demonstrates its potential in building modern web applications.

## Features

- Clean and Modern Design: A visually appealing interface designed for a great user experience.
- Responsive Layout: Adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- Modular Components: Reusable components for ease of maintenance and scalability.
- Dynamic Content Rendering: Populate the profile page with dynamic user data.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs seamlessly across different browsers and environments.



## Technologies Used
- Language: Dart
- Framework: Dart Web
- Styling: CSS
- Tools:    
    - Dart `http` package for API integration (if included)
    - Dart's `Material` or custom widgets for UI components
